            <p>
              While working on a cost capturing project, I identified inefficiencies in material and labor cost applications during receiving and shipping. To gain deeper insights, I spent time on the warehouse floor, particularly focusing on the journey of pickers as they received orders and navigated through the warehouse. The analysis revealed several inefficiencies, including:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2">
              <li>Pickers zigzagging inefficiently through the warehouse</li>
              <li>Varied warehouse layouts and rack configurations</li>
              <li>High-frequency products often shipped with less frequent items, ordering by frequency alone as insufficient</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Task</h3>
            <p>
              Our goal was to develop a warehouse optimization system that enables managers and supervisors to print out a document to reorganize products based on frequency and order combinations. The system needed to accommodate different warehouse layouts and sizes, and include a recommendation engine that would suggest optimal product placements based on historical data, seasonality, and product combinations.

          <p className="mb-2">We developed an application that grouped products by client or warehouse, organized by frequency over a set duration (defaulted to 3 months based on seasonality). The project involved:</p>

            <li>Data Integration: Grouped products based on their frequency of shipping within a specified timeframe.</li>
            <li>Machine Learning: Applied hierarchical clustering using a distance matrix to create 3-12 groups of products, allowing flexibility for different warehouse capacities.</li>
            <li>Output: The system generated an Excel spreadsheet with multiple tabs, providing managers with a detailed, customizable layout for product placement.</li>

            The successful testing of the recommendation system on a new client with historical data validated the systemâ€™s accuracy and effectiveness. This proof of concept provided warehouse managers and supervisors with the confidence to implement the system, leading to more efficient warehouse operations and reduced labor costs.
