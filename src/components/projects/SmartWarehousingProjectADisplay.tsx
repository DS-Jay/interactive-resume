            Final mile delivery has long been a challenge for 3PL systems, as ensuring that products are stored closest to their final destination is crucial for cost efficiency. According to a report by McKinsey & Company, there is potential for a 6-8% savings in final mile costs if 3PLs move approximately 70% of clients' products one or more zones closer to their final destinations by creating additional injection sites.

            <p>
              Through meetings with SMEs and evaluating shipping location and cost data, it became apparent that there were significant inefficiencies in the 3PL company's product shipping strategy. Products were often shipped from distant warehouses, such as from California to the East Coast, despite the availability of closer warehouse locations within the companyâ€™s network.

            <p>
              Our goal was to analyze the client's product storage locations and the distances they travel to their final mile destinations, identifying which products and companies would benefit the most from relocating their products closer to their demand locations, while still adhering to service level agreements.
